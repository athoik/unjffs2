Hi,

this tool converts a NFI image into a CF image.

It does this by first extracting the different jffs2 images into files, then
using the included "dump" tool to unpack them.

Then, a rootfs-image is created using "genext2fs", which must be installed!

So,

first compile the jffs2 tool using "make",

then run 

./ripimage.py dreambox-image-dm7025-20060318161653.nfi

which will result in a "root.ext2" file and a "boot" directory.

create two partitions on a compact flash disk, format the first one as VFAT
(should be ~4MB), copy the boot/ contents there.

then rawwrite the root.ext2 file into the second partition (60MB by default,
can be changed in ripimage.py)

this can probably be improved to do this automatically. A problem is that
there is no tool (at least none that i knew of) to create a msdos filesystem
without being root (i.e. with kernel help, loopmounts etc.).
